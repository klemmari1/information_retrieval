## Weighting schemas and relevance scores
The results of the weighting schemas varied a bit depending on which schema was used. Using the euclidean distance as relevance score seemed to prefer empty documents while cosine similarity discraded these.


## Evaluation metrics
The evaluation metrics show that the TF-IDF is the best weighting schema for this dataset (2nd. TF, 3rd Binary) and using the cosine similarity measure got the best accuracy scores with euclidean distance sometimes giving the same or better accuracy but usually falling behind.
